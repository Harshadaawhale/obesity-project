# obesity-project

The objective of this project was to build a model that predicts the obesity classification of individuals based on various features such as gender, age, height, weight, eating habits, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors.

Key aspects of my include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the dataset and identify patterns.

Data Cleaning: Removed outliers to ensure the integrity of the data.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Applied various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Utilized ANN for enhanced prediction accuracy
